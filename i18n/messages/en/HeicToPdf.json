      "question": "How do I convert a HEIC to PDF?",
      "answer": "The conversion process is simple: upload the HEIC file into a design project and download it in the desired PDF format. You can also edit the file before downloading or customize the PDF to make it more professional-looking."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Why convert HEIC to PDF?",
      "answer": "HEIC files that are converted to PDF become easy to share, open, and download across different devices and operating systems. That is because PDF is an open file format. Converting HEIC images to PDF also compresses their file size, freeing up storage space and saving you the cost of paying for more. And despite their reduced size, PDF files retain the quality and details of the original images after conversion."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "How to convert multiple HEIC files to PDF?",

Add multiple pages and arrange their layout according to how you want them to appear or based on your selected project template.
