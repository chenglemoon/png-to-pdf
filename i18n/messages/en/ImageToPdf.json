      "answer": "Using our free Image to PDF converter, you can edit your images online before saving them in PDF. You also get to choose which PDF format to convert your image to. Download your design in PDF Standard for digital purposes, especially for mobile use and drive storage since they don't take up much space. PDF Print is perfect for printing because of its higher resolution than PDF Standard and allows you to add crop marks and bleed for professional-looking prints."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Why convert images to PDF?",
      "answer": "Image files that are converted to PDF become easy to share, open, and download across different devices and operating systems. That is because PDF is an open file format. Converting images to PDF also compresses their file size, freeing up storage space and saving you the cost of paying for more. And despite their reduced size, PDF files retain the quality and details of the original images after conversion."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "How to convert multiple image files to PDF?",
      "answer": "Our online Image to PDF converter lets you convert multiple image files to a single PDF document. Simply drag and drop the images you want to convert into your design project. Add multiple pages and arrange their layout according to how you want them to appear or based on your selected project template. Edit each image then download your design in PDF Standard or PDF Print format."
