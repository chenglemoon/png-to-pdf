      "answer": "Using our free BMP to PDF converter, you can edit your BMP images online before saving them in PDF. You also get to choose which PDF format to convert your image to. Download your design in PDF Standard for digital purposes, especially for mobile use and drive storage since they don't take up much space. PDF Print is perfect for printing because of its higher resolution than PDF Standard and allows you to add crop marks and bleed for professional-looking prints."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Why convert BMP to PDF?",
      "answer": "BMP files that are converted to PDF become easy to share, open, and download across different devices and operating systems. That is because PDF is an open file format. Converting BMP images to PDF also compresses their file size, freeing up storage space and saving you the cost of paying for more. And despite their reduced size, PDF files retain the quality and details of the original images after conversion."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "How to convert multiple BMP files to PDF?",
      "answer": "Our online BMP to PDF converter lets you convert multiple BMP files to a single PDF document. Simply drag and drop the BMP images you want to convert into your design project. Add multiple pages and arrange their layout according to how you want them to appear or based on your selected project template. Edit each image then download your design in PDF Standard or PDF Print format."
