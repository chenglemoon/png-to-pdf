    "q3": {
      "question": "When would you need to flip an image?",

An image mirror flip can have added symmetry or improved orientation, making it better-looking than the original. Furthermore, our eyes are often drawn from left to right when looking at a photo.

      "question": "Is there a file size limit?",

    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Is my image data safe and private?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! All image processing happens directly in your browser using advanced web technologies. Your images never leave your device, ensuring complete privacy and security. We don't store or have access to any of your images."
    },

      "question": "Is this image flipper free to use?",
